# Big Data Analytics & Deep Learning Implementation
Analyzed Big Data case for Car Dataset (Toyota) from Kaggle with Python (PySpark) and Jupyter as a tool programming using Supervised Learning with Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Linear Regression for visualization data.

Deep Learning Implementation too for Image Recommender with Python and Jupyter as a tool programming using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and VGG16 as an architecture.
